# Student Grade Calculator

This Java program calculates a student's grade.

## How it works

1. **Input:** The program prompts the user to enter the total number of subjects.  It then asks for the marks obtained in each subject.
2. **Calculation:**  The program calculates the total marks and then determines the percentage.
3. **Grade Determination:** The program uses a function `grade(perc)` to assign a letter grade (A+, A, B, C, D, F) based on the calculated percentage.
4. **Output:**  The program displays the total marks, the percentage, and the final grade.
